IE needs 512+ bytes: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ieinternals/archive/2010/08/19/http-error-pages-in-internet-explorer.aspx 

Unfortunately, IE's logic isn't smart enough to detect that, say, the response was a tiny HTML page with a META Refresh pointed at a different page, meaning that the META Refresh won't work until you pad the HTML response with enough text to be deemed "non-terse."

A common question from web developers is: What makes IE decide to show a friendly error page?

The answer is that the server's response must meet two criteria:

The HTTP Status code must be [400, 403, 404, 405, 406, 408, 409, 410, 500, 501, 505]
The HTTP Response body's byte length must be shorter than a threshold value
If the server's response meets both criteria, then IE will show its own Friendly HTTP Error page instead of the server's terse response.

The byte length thresholds are stored in the registry in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE under the subkey \SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Main\ErrorThresholds. The default threshold is 256 bytes for the response codes [403, 405, 410] and 512 bytes for response codes [400, 404, 406, 408, 409, 500, 501, 505]. If the registry entry is missing for one of the status codes, its threshold defaults to 512 bytes.
